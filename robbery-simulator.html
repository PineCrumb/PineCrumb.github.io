I worked on the 2.0 update for Robbery Simulator, a simulator game by <a class="text-link" href="https://voldex.com/">Voldex</a>
where players steal items from shops and sell them to continually progress.
In this update, I was in charge of missions, which included:

<ul>
<li>Creating a missions system</li>
<li>Designing fun missions and implementing them</li>
<li>Working with game artists to turn blockouts into mission environments</li>
</ul>

I was also in charge of redesigning much of the gameâ€™s hud, adding additional elements to support missions and making other elements easier to navigate.

As the designer for missions, I closely collaborated with artists to ensure a seamless mission development process.
I constructed fully playable blockouts, which were subsequently handed over to artists for making the mission come to life.

Once the missions were fully playable, I led coordination with QA to not only test for bugs, but also record their
playthrough progress to find pain points and see which values needed to be tweaked. This was vital for ensuring the
game met all of its targets, such as playthrough moments that incentivized the player to purchase robux items and speed up progress.
