`
Steelfront is an innovative all-out strategic war combat game in development by Rarefront,
a cooperative studio founded by my lifelong friend <a class="text-link" href="https://metaproxi.github.io/Portfolio/index.html">MetaProx</a>. In a dynamic world designed
to be repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt during rounds lasting hours, the project aims
to provide players with an unparalleled combat immersion experience unlike anything they've ever played.
<br>
Although we’ve currently paused development to focus on our solo careers, the game has been a source of
some of my most passionate work this year, driving me to push the envelop of what is possible in a roblox combat experience.

`
Unlike other combat games, I’ve worked tirelessly to make <b>everything</b> the player sees in Steelfront is entirely destructible:
terrain, buildings, set pieces, even vehicles.
<br>
To make this work, I countlessly iterated on design methods alongside programming them,
settling on a “brick” system that allows any primitive geometric part to be decimated into “bricks”, and for bricks to be objects that inherit
simple to complex functionality.
<br>
To make it all work well, I’ve implemented common programming patterns for feasability and performance,
such as a <u>mark and sweep algorithm</u> and <u>object pooling</u>.

                desc:

`
Programming and developing vehicles in Steelfront has been a fantastic challenge.
Vehicles consist of bricks that are manually connected by designers using a custom plugin.
While some bricks are simple geometry, others possess robust functionalities, such as tank barrels,
wheels, and headlights – all of which can be disabled when players destroy them. They’re also completley
repairable during runtime with a tool.
<br>
For peak gameplay, many vehicles feature complex replication methods for best results, like
separating the tank's visual render from its collision to ensure precise and seamless performance.

`
In Steelfront, players have the agency and control to build bases that can completley turn the tide of match.
Crates are a versatile game object for this - whether coming from your own side, finding them on the field,
or stealing a truck full of them from the eneomy. I’ve designed and programmed the entirety of this system,
and inspired by classic RTSs, I’m extremley happy with the potential for ingenuity I’m offering players.
<br>
And of course - bases are completley destructible.
