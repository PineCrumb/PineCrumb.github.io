City 8 Roleplay was a project I took up not only as work, but also out of a sheer love for the Half Life franchise.
<span class = "new-line"></span>
Assigned to gameplay, I had a blast making Headcrabs and APCs from the series into playable Roblox mechanics, and have
been thrilled to see other Half Life fans enjoy my work on the game since then.

`
Given an existing chassis,
I set out to make APCs in Half-Life as cool as possible. I designed and implemented a vehicle that accommodates one
player as the driver while providing seats for others in the back. I also used original sounds from Half-Life 2 and made the turret
work lore accurately, as well as causing it to overheat when fired too often.
<span class = "new-line"></span>
Seeing players organize fleets of APCs has made this vehicle one of my favorite creations for the Roblox roleplaying community.

`
Having full creative freedom over the headcrab, I made a state based AI that remains idle until it detects a player,
at which point it starts chasing and leaping towards them, attempting to attach itself to their head. Once successfully attached,
the player transforms into a headcrab zombie and is no longer targeted by other headcrabs.
<span class = "new-line"></span>
Along with programming them, I also had the opportunity to flex my 3D creative skills with fully modeling and texturing the headcrab.
