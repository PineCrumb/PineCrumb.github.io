"King of the Krill" was a project I developed for fun during my college years at SCAD, using it as a vessel for occasional design assignments.
<span class = "new-line"></span>
The idea of the game was to reimagine the simulator genre as a PVP roguelike experience, where players collected pellets to advance in the core game and coins to advance their progress in the meta game.
<span class = "new-line"></span>
Players also chose from different fish classes, each offering unique abilities with their own depth and strategy to the gameplay.

In keeping with the silly concept of a fish fighting game, I had a lot of fun designing UI that was fun and playful during the concepting stage.
<span class = "new-line"></span>
Once I was happy with it, I took said UI and put a lot of working translating the screens into user-friendly interfaces, making sure they were practical
to use while still keeping the fun aesthetic that made the game stand out.
